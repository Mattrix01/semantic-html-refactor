# semantic-html-refactor

I started with commenting through the html code to identify the secion.
Then I changed the div tags accordingly, main, aside etc.
I then commented throughout the CSS to match ti up to the html, by doing this I could identify the order of the CSS and make changes.
I also used group selectors in CSS for duplications to make a smaller more manageable code.
I also added added alt attributes to the images for SEO purposes.
I regularly checked the html on a live server to make sure my chanages were semantic and not effecting the appearence and functionaility of the page.
