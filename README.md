## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS

## Steps taken

- I started with commenting through the html code to identify each section of the page.

- Then I changed the div tags accordingly, main, aside etc.

- I then commented throughout the CSS to match it up to the html, by doing this I could identify the order of the CSS and make changes.

- I also used group selectors in CSS for duplications to make a smaller more manageable code.

- I also added added alt attributes to the images for SEO purposes.

- I regularly checked the html on a live server to make sure my chanages were semantic and not effecting the appearence and functionaility of the page.
